<title>Plugin Manager</title>


<div class="overview">
We're going to look at how to install and manage IDV plugins. A much easier way of 
sharing IDV configurations.
</div>

<ol class="step">
    <li> Bring up the Plugin Manager with the [ht::menu Tools {Plugin Manager}] menu.
<ifndef flag_developerworkshop>
    <li> Note the &quot;Workshop IDV&quot; plugin. Click on its <img src="images/FindAgain16.gif"> button to view the contents.
</ifndef>
    <li> Lets install some of these plugins
    <ul>
        <li> Under &quot;Displays&quot; install  the  &quot;User Interface Skins&quot; plugin.
        <li> Under &quot;Color Tables&quot; install the GEMPAK color tables.
	<li> View the contents of the GEMPAK color tables. Find the gempak.rbi in the list and view its contents
	     by clicking on its <img src="images/FindAgain16.gif"> button.
         <li> Shut down the IDV and restart.
         <li> Go to the  [ht::button New Windows] tab under [ht::button Quicklinks]. Note the new windows. These came from the skins plugin. 
        <li> Delete the User Interface Skins plugin. 
    </ul>
    <li> The IDV supports (sortof) multiple languages.
    <ul>
    <li> Look at the  Language Pack plugins and install one of them.
    <li> Exit and restart the IDV.
    <li> Exit and restart the IDV with the [ht::filename -noplugins] argument.
    <li> Uninstall the Language Pack plugin
    </ul>

    <li> We also have a simple IDV.
    <ul>
       <li> Under &quot;Customized IDVs&quot; install the &quot;Simple IDV&quot;
       <li> Exit, restart and note the changes.
       <li> The Plugin Manager is under the [ht::menu File] menu now. Remove the Simple IDV plugin.
    </ul>


    <li> So, again you might ask &quot;But Jeff, how do I take all of the resources I've created in the IDV and turn them into
one of these plugins?&quot;

    <li> I'm glad you asked that question. Next page...

</ol>
