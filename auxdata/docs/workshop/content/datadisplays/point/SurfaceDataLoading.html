<p>
METAR and Synoptic data can be accessed in the IDV from
ADDE servers.  The data available is hourly, each hourly file having 
 all station observations at that time.

<ol class="step">

<li>Open the Surface Data Source Chooser</li>
  <ul class="substep">
    <li>[ht::clearDisplaysAndData]
    <li> [ht::openDataSourceChooser] 
    <li>In the [ht::dialog Data Source Chooser] click on the 
    [ht::command Point] tab. 
    <li>In the 
    [ht::command Server:] entry box, select the remote ADDE server 
    [ht::command adde.ucar.edu].
    <li>In the [ht::command Data Type:] entry box, select the choice 
    [ht::command Surface (METAR) Data].
    <li>Click on [ht::button Connect].
    <li>The IDV will connect to the ADDE server at adde.ucar.edu and
    download metadata about available METAR data. Select 
    [ht::command Absolute times] to see a list of data times that you 
    can get from this server.
    <li>The bottom time in the list, 
    the most recent time, should be highlighted.
    If it is not, click on it.
    <LI>Hold down the shift key and click on the time one above the bottom,
    so that two times are selected.
    <LI>You could also select [ht::command Use relative times] and select
    [ht::command Most recent 2 times].
    <li>If the entry box [ht::command Station Model:] does not show METAR, 
    select METAR.
    <li>Click the [ht::button Add Source] button at the 
    bottom of the selector window. 
  <li> Because the [ht::button Create Display] checkbox is on in the chooser the IDV automatically creates a point data plot.
  </ul>
