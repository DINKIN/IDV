<div class="overview">
    In this section, we are going to look at the IDV's support of reading in point observation
     data in a text comma separated value (CSV) file format.

      <p> In the example above, the first line's structure is a mapping of domain parameter.
           The second line defines the formatting and units of the parameters.
           Starting the third line is the data section of this sample.
      </p>



    <li> Load text point data without header.
    <ul>
     <li> [ht::openDataSourceChooser]
     <li> In the [ht::dialog Data Source Chooser] click on the
         [ht::command Files] tab.
     <li> Go to the point data directory:     [ht::filename <%workshop.datadir%>/point/].
     <li> Select [ht::filename metar.csv]
     <li> Under the [ht::command Data Source Type] pulldown menu, select &quot;Text Point Data files&quot;
     <li> Press [ht::button Add Source], and the Text Point Metadata Gui will pop up.
     <li> Notice the header part of this csv file being commenting out.
    </ul>

    <li>Using the Text Point Metadata Gui
    <ul>
    <li> At the top a number of the initial lines from the text data are shown.
         The arrow keys allow you to specify the start line. For example, if you had
         some other header information you can skip over those commenting lines.

    <li> For each column of text data there is a row shown in the bottom of the dialog.
        This shows the sampled value and allows you to enter a name, unit, date format, missing
        value and extra information. These parameters are:
        &quot;Time &quot;,&quot;Latitude&quot;, &quot;Longitude&quot;, &quot;T&quot;,
        &quot;ROW&quot;, &quot;DIR&quot;,and &quot;SPD&quot;.
    <li> After entering all the fields and you want to keep from having to do this again next time
        you load a new text point data of the form simply press the &quot;Preferences&quot; button
        and select [ht::menu {Save Current}]. This allows you to save these metadata settings and
        reapply them later using the &quot;Preferences&quot; button.
  
    </ul>


    <li> Create the display.
    <ul>
    <li> In the [ht::command Fields] panel select [ht::param Point Data].
    <li> In the [ht::command Displays]  select [ht::display Point Data List] and press
         [ht::button Create Display]
    <li> In the control window, use the [ht::command Layout Model] selector box to
        change station model from LOCATION to METAR.
    </ul>
