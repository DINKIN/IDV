<title>Loading WSR-88D Level II Radar Data</title>

<p>

<div class="overview">
<p>
Level II data is accessed in the IDV from files on your 
local disk, each file having data from one WSR-88D radar 
for all sweeps (tilt) for one time. 
</div>

<P>
<details link="Read more about Receiving and Storing Level II Data">
<P>
The Level II data is supplied as volume-scan files, each file having all
data from one WSR-88D radar for all sweeps for one &quot;time&quot;.
Unidata Community sites can receive Level II data using the 
<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/content/software/ldm/index.html">
Unidata Local Data Manager (LDM)</a>. Archived Level II data is
available from the <a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/"> National
Climatic Data Center (NCDC)</a> (data from NCDC must be un-tarred and
optionally, uncompressed for better performance).

<p> The files should be stored on your file system with each station's
files in a directory (folder) whose directory name is the station
4-character ID (e.g., KDVN for Davenport, Iowa). In many cases the data
files do not have any location information in them and the IDV uses the
directory name as a first guess at the station location. If you are
working with data files where the directory name is not the station id,
there is a way to specify the station in the IDV. </details>


<P>

For the exercises in this section, we will use Level II data 
corresponding to the same times as the Level III data we used from
the Bow Echo Case study in in the workshop dataset.  See 
[ht::popup ../../installandstart/LocalData.html "Installing local datasets"]
for more information if you need to install these data.</p>

<ol class="step">

<li>Setup for Level II displays</li>
  <ul class="substep">
    <li>[ht::clearDisplaysAndData]
    <li>Make sure the menu item
    [ht::menu Projections {Auto-set Projection}] option is checked on.
    <li> Show the 3D wireframe box by toggling on the main menu item
    [ht::menu View Show {Wireframe Box}]</code>.
    </ul>
</li>

<li>Open the Level II Data Source Chooser</li>
  <ul class="substep">
    <li> [ht::openDataSourceChooser] 
    <li>
    In the [ht::dialog Data Source Chooser]
    click on the [ht::tab Radar] tab. 
    Then click on the [ht::tab Level II]
    tab to see the Level II radar data chooser panel. 
    <li>Use the directory (folder) selector to find the radar 
        station data you want. 
        <ul class="substep">
        <li>Go to the directory where the data are stored (e.g., 
        [ht::filename <%workshop.datadir%>/level2/]).
        <li>Go to the directory with the name of the station id, KDVN.
        <li>Select all the files. [ht::listSelect]
        <li>Click the [ht::button {Add Source}] button. 
        </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>

</ol>

<div class="cimg"><img src="images/LevelII.gif"></div>

The data source  [ht::dataset Level II Radar (TLX)]
appears in the [ht::command Data Sources] list in 
the [ht::dialog Field Selector]. 

<p>

<div class="cimg"><img src="images/LevelIIDataSource.gif"></div>

<p>

Lets look at some of the properties of this dataset.

<p>
<li>[ht::editDataSourceProperties [ht::dataset {Level II Radar Data (DVN)}]]

<div class="cimg"><img src="images/LevelIIProperties.gif"></div>


    <ul class="substep">
      <li>If you are looking at realtime data, you can set up the file
          polling information here to automatically reload new data  as
          it becomes available.
      <li>If the volume scans do not contain station information and
          you did not set the station information in the chooser, you
          can change the location using the widget in the properties 
          dialog.
      <li>Subset the times and choose the last five times from
           1998-06-29 21:35:57Z to 1998-06-29 21:59:36Z and click
           [ht::button OK].
    </ul>
</ul>

Level II data has three [ht::command Fields] (radar data moments or data types).  
The IDV has several display types for Level II data. Any of  
the moments can be shown with any of the displays.  For the following
exercises, we will use Reflectivity.
