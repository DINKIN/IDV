<ol class="step">

<li>Access realtime level II data from the file system from the 
Level II Data Source Chooser</li>
  <ul class="substep">
    <li> [ht::openDataSourceChooser] 
    <li>
    In the [ht::dialog Data Source Chooser]
    click on the [ht::tab Radar] tab. 
    Then click on the [ht::tab Level II]
    tab to see the Level II radar data chooser panel. 
    <li>From the [ht::command Relative Times] selector, select the
    [ht::command Use Most Recent 5 files].
    <li>Use the directory (folder) selector to find the radar 
        station data you want. 
        <ul class="substep">
        <li>Go to the directory where the data are stored (e.g., 
        [ht::filename /data/gempak/nexrad/craft]).
        <li>Pick a station that has weather today.
        <li>Click the [ht::button {Add Source}] button. 
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>[ht::editDataSourceProperties]
    <li>In the [ht::command Polling] section, check the [ht::command Active]
        option and set the [ht::command Check every] box to 5 minutes, then
        click [ht::button OK].</li>
    <li>Select the [ht::param Reflectivity] field and the
        [ht::display Radar Sweep View in 2D] display, then click
        [ht::button Create Display].</li>
    <li>Wait for 5 minutes and see that the display reloads with
        new data.
  </ul>

<li>Multiple Radars</li>
  <ul class="substep">
    <li>Load Level II data for three or four times from three adjacent stations 
    which have some detectable signals over the combined area.
    <li> Make 2D sweeps plots from all stations. Experiment to see if the
    order you display data from stations makes a difference.
    <li>Display the same data with 3D sweeps and rotate the view window
     to see intersecting sweeps.
  </ul>
</li>

<li>Multiple Data Sources</li>
  <ul class="substep">
    <li>Select a satellite data source that covers a region of the
    US that includes radars with echos.
    <li>Overlay the satellite image with Level II radar data.
  </ul>
</li>

</ol>
