{{Points} {
This is an option for the initializing the trajectory initial area. When the control is first created, it is the default
option. Every time the user left-clicks on the view window, a marker is placed to mark a initial point. After the trajectory

user changes the initial option, the display of the initial area and the trajectory on the view window will be removed.
