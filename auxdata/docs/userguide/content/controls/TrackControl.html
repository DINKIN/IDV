{{Time Mode} {





Even though a track represents a set of observation times
there is not time set defined for animating in the main display.
The time mode allows for the  control of
how much of the track is shown and from what time.
Select the [ug::button Change] button to show the [ug::button Time Settings] dialog:

[ht::cimg images/TrackControlTimeSettings.gif]

This dialog  allows you to define the time range to show of the track. The image
above defines that the end time is the current animation time. The start time
is relative to the end time less 30 minutes.
<p>
This time setting is similar to that used for the general 
<a href="../ui/Animation.html#animationset">time animation</a>.
