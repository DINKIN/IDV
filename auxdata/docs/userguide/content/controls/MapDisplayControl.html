{Map  Control}

{
Maps in the IDV are shown using the Map display control. There are  two ways this 
control is used: as  the default  background maps and as a user created map display.
The control window is composed of two tabs. The first lists the set of
available maps:

The second allows the user to control the display of the latitude/longitude lines
and control the Z level of the maps:

New maps may be added through the [ug::menu Edit] menu. You can choose to add any of the predefined
maps available to the IDV or you can select a map file (e.g., a shape file)  from the
file system.
<p>
The  [ug::menu Edit {Save  as the Default Map Preference}] menu item  allows you to save the current
set of maps in a display as the default maps. When a new view window is created the maps that
are saved as the default are used as the background maps.
}


{{Maps} {
This list shows the set of currently loaded maps. In this list you can remove a map, change
its visibility, line width, style and color. The [ug::button Fast Rendering] button, when on,
can save on rendering time by not checking for projection seam crossings. Note: some maps
will display incorrectly when fast rendering is turned on.
}}


{ {Latitude/Longitude lines} {
These controls allow you to display latitude and longitude lines. You can set the visibility,
spacing, line width, line style and color.
}}


{ {Map position} {
This slider  allows you to  set the vertical position of the maps.
