<faq qlabel="Problem:" alabel="Description:" cat="Bugs and problems">

<faqitem cat="System"></faqitem>

<faqitem q="Bad version number in .class file" id="java6">
IDV 2.8 requires Java 6 and most systems have Java 6 as the default 
version.  On Mac OS-X, prior to the Snow Leopard release (10.6), Java 5 is 
the default version of Java.  If you are not running Snow Leopard, you will
need to update your Java version.  See the 
<a href="Systems.html#os">System Requirements</a> for information on updating
Java on Mac OS-X.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="ClassNotFoundException: ucar.unidata.repository.InteractiveRepositoryClient" id="ramadda">
If you installed the RAMADDA plugin in a previous version of IDV, you will 
need to remove and reinstall it in version 2.8.  Use the Plugin Manager
to do this.  You cannot use the new RAMADDA plugin with a previous version of
IDV though.  If you want to use a previous version as well as 2.8, you will
need to uninstall the RAMADDA plugin and remove the publishers.xml file in
the .unidata/idv/DefaultIdv directory under your home directory.

<faqitem q="Incorrect data display" id="dataprojection">
Sometimes data depictions display incorrectly or not at all when 
re-projected from native data projections.  They should always
display correctly in their native projections.  Before you display the 
data, choose the [ug::menu Projections {Auto-Set Projection}] menu.
If you display the data in a non-native projection and Use Fast Rendering
is set (the default) and the data does not correctly display, turn
off Use Fast Rendering through the [ug::menu Edit Properties] menu
of the display control to account for projection seams.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Spurious map lines" id="maplines">
Starting with IDV 2.7, some computers are experiencing spurious map
lines in their displays.  This seems to be a graphics driver issue being
tickled by a change in this and later versions.  If you are experiencing
this, please use the [ug::menu Edit Preferences], [ht::command System] tab,
uncheck the "Enable geometry by reference" option, click 
[ht::command OK] and restart the IDV. That should clear up the spurious lines.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Irregular animation loop" id="irregular_animation">
An animation loop of two or more displays may not advance the
individual displays at exactly the same time in each step, creating a
staggered or irregular loop, on some systems. Use the individual time 
step buttons to step through the frames, one at a time, 
to avoid the irregular loading.</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Time label in menu is not in sync with an animation loop."
id="timesync">
Use the on-display time label
turned on with the [ug::menu  View {Show times in display}] menu.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Multiple vector displays" id="multivector">
If you have multiple vector displays and you change the size, autosize,
color, or streamline options in the control, changes may be applied
to the other displays as well.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Vector size changes" id="vectorsizechanges">
The first time you change the color on a vector plan view
display, the size of the vectors/barbs may shrink.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Contours over topography do not show up." id="contour_over_topo">
If you display a 2D field as contours draped over topography, the
contours may not show up.  There may be two reasons for this:
<ol>
<li>You are using the Direct-X version of Java 3D on Windows which
does not support the polygon offset feature.  Try the OpenGL version
instead.
<li>On some systems, the ordering of the displays can affect the 
visibility.  Until the IDV support layering, try adding the 
contours after the topography field.
</ol>
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Changing the line width on maps, curves, etc has no effect." id="linewidth">
If you are using the Direct-X version of Java 3D on Windows, 
changing line width has no effect.  Direct-X does not support setting
the line width features.  Try using the OpenGL version instead.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="For a color shaded display, changing the display unit does not
give the correct image colors." id="color_unit">
If you change the display unit for a color shaded display, the color
table range values will look correct, but the display will not be
correct.  Set the display unit again and it will update correctly.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Setting a display transparent has no effect" id="transparency">
Using transparency in a color display may give unexpected results.
In general, only the last thing added can be fully transparent.
If you have a display that is transparent, then add in a new display,
you may not see it.  The problem is caused by the lack of ordering
in Java 3D.   You can use the display control's View-&gt;Bring to Front
menu to remove and re-add the display that you want to be transparent 
so it is last.
</faqitem>


<faqitem q="Projection lost for dimensionless vertical coordinates" id="cf_projection">
If you have a grid which uses a dimensionless CF vertical coordinate 
convention, the original projection information is lost when you try
to display it.  This is a result of keeping a relationship between
the dimensionless coordinate and the corresponding height values.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Color scale disappears in perspective view" id="perspective_scale">
If you have the map display in a perspective view, a background image
that extends beyond the box boundaries will hide any color scales in
the display.  Two workarounds are: 1) use parallel view
(uncheck [ug::menu View Viewpoint {Perspective View}]) or 2) clip
the view at the box ([ug::menu View Show {Clip View At Box}]).
</faqitem>

<faqitem cat="Data/Derived quantities/Formulas/Jython"></faqitem>

<faqitem q="Staggered grids in CF or WRF conventions unsupported or
give incorrect results for slices and derived parameters" id="stagger">
Staggered grids create some problems for the IDV and associated
displays.  Derived quantities do not work well (if at all).   If
possible, write your data out on unstaggered grids.
</faqitem>


<faqitem cat="Choosers"></faqitem>

<faqitem q="Image chooser selector box looks disabled" id="disabled_chooser">
In some instances, an override selector box in the advanced 
section of the default image chooser will appear disabled 
(i.e., grayed out) even when its checkbox is checked.
Even though it appears disabled, you can still use the selector
box to make choices. If you want it to appear enabled, uncheck 
then check the checkbox again.
