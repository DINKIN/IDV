You can access RAOB data either from remote ADDE servers 
(using the [ug::chooser Soundings: Remote] chooser, pictured below) or
from local files (using  the [ug::chooser Soundings: Local] chooser).
The only difference between these two choosers is specifying
the source of data. You either select an ADDE server and press
[ug::button Connect] or you select a file containing RAOB data.

To select RAOB data you:
<ol>
<li> Choose the server or the local file. The list of times will be 
displayed. In this chooser you select particular stations at particular
times.

<li> Select a set of dates and times that you want to use.
To select more than one time use Control-Click or Shift-Click.

<li> Select one or more stations for the given time using the map.
See <a href="#stationmap">below</a> for more information on
how to use the station map.

<li> Once selected the station/time combination will be shown in the
<b>Selected Stations</b>.

<li> When done, load the selected RAOB data with the [ug::button Add Source] button.


</ol>

RAOB data can also be selected (from an ADDE server) as a single level.
This data can then be displayed as a station model.

To select single level RAOB data you:
<ol>
<li> Select an ADDE server and data type and press [ug::button Connect].

<li> Either, choose a relative set of times steps (e.g., Last 5 times).

<li> Or, choose a set of absolute times (e.g., 12Z, 1Z); When choosing 
absolute times for the first time the IDV needs to query the ADDE server 
for the times. This may take some time.  
Times can be selected in the list or the time line
(use control/click or shift/click in the list to select multiple times).
See the <a href="../../tools/Timeline.html">Timeline section</a> for details on its use.


<li> Select the level you want to view.

<li> Optionally select the station model to be used for displaying this data.

<li> When done, load the selected RAOB  data  with the [ug::button Add Source] button.


</ol>
