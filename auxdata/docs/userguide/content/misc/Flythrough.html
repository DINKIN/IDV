[ug::head {Flythrough}]

The Map views have a &quot;Flythrough&quot; facility that allows for flying through the view.
This is accessed through the [ug::menu View Flythrough] menu.
The Flythrough operates in 2 modes - first the user can just bring up the Flythrough dialog
and fly around the view interactively. The second mode is to define a set of points which defines
the path to follow.

The Flythrough dialog consists of a set of tabs. The first tab is the Dashboard which gives
a simulacrum  of an airplane dashboard:

In the Map View a small airplane icon is shown that denotes the current position. A vertical probe line
is shown to indicate the location of the viewpoint. The map in the middle of the dashboard shows the current
location and the red outline is (roughly) the lat/lon bounds of the Map View.
