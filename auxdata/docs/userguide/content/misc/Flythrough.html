[ug::head {Flythrough}]

The Map views have a &quot;Flythrough&quot; facility that allows for flying through the view.
This is accessed through the [ug::menu View Flythrough] menu.
The Flythrough operates in 2 modes - first the user can just bring up the Flythrough dialog
and fly around the view interactively. The second mode is to define a set of points which defines
the path to follow.

The Flythrough dialog consists of a set of tabs. The first tab is the Dashboard which gives
a simulacrum  of an airplane dashboard:

In the Map View a small airplane icon is shown that denotes the current position. A vertical probe line
is shown to indicate the location of the viewpoint. The map in the middle of the dashboard shows the current
location and the red outline is (roughly) the lat/lon bounds of the Map View. A compass and location readout is alsoshown.


<div class="pagesubtitle">Probing Data</div>
If there are other displays in the same view that have data then as one flys through the view
the data will be sampled at the location of the flythrough and be shown as gauges in the dashboard.
The actual values will be listed under the Values tab. This operates the same way as when one interactively
does a middle-mouse drag in the view. The IDV samples the data at the latitude/longitude/altitude of
the flythrough point and the current animation time. A time series chart will also be shown in the dashboard 
(you might have to enlarge the window to see it.

<div class="pagesubtitle">Background Images</div>
If you have the IDV webcam display being shown then the nearest image to the current flythrough
point will be shown as a background image in the Dashboard tab. This can be turned off
with the [ug::menu View Dashboard {Show background images}] menu item.


<div class="pagesubtitle">Flying along a Trajectory</div>
The other to flythrough a view is by flying along a trajectory, i.e., a set of points in
3D space and (possibly) time.  The set of points can come from a number of sources:
<ul>
<li> 
<li> 
<li> 

</ul>


<p>
You can export and import the set of points in a flythrough with the [ug::menu File Export/Import] menu.
This is a simple xml format that
