<faqitem q="New Image Chooser" id="newimagechooser">
Added an image preview panel in the <a href="./data/DataSourceProperties.html#spatialsubset"> data subset</a> panel,
and moved the image property widgets from the original chooser to the Advanced panel in the subset window.
The result is a more intuitive and efficient user experience when selecting the area of interest before
creating the final display.

<faqitem q="Match Display Region" id="matchdisplayregion">
The IDV can now match display regions. When the user selects this option in the data source property
or subset panel, the IDV will automatically spatially subset to match the display area in the view window.
This is done by first setting a region of interested in the main
view window, and selecting "Match Display Region" in the Region tab of the subset panel. If the
"Match Display Region" option is not selected before creating the display, you can re-set this option
under View menu of the <a href="./controls/index.html#DisplayControlViewMenu">Display Control</a>.
If the data source type is grid file, the IDV user can set "Match Display Region" as a default property in the
<a href="./data/DataSourceProperties.html#spatialsubset">Data Source Properties</a> window.
</faqitem>


<faqitem q="Adaptive Resolution" id="adaptiveresolution">
This is a new advanced feature in the IDV. When loading large datasets with PR enabled, the IDV calculates the
resolution of the map view window, dynamically sets the data sampling, and loads sufficient data to generate
the image. The quality of the image is not compromised. The result of this improvement is more efficient use
of both client and server system resources thereby reducing network traffic significantly. The Adaptive Resolution
is a property in the <a href="./tools/Preferences.html">User Preference</a>. It can also be set in the
<a href="./ui/Menus.html#projectionmenu">Projections</a> drop down menu of main view window.
