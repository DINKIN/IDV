<faqitem q="Smoothing of grids" id="gridsmooth">
Selected grid displays (contours, flow vectors, wind barbs) now have
an option to perform smoothing functions on the grid.  The GEMPAK
5-point (SM5S), 9-point (SM9S) and Gaussian Weighted Function (GWFS)
smoothing functions have been implemented in the IDV.  Users can select
one of these functions in the display <a href="controls/index.html">
control window</a> and/or save these
as a <a href="tools/DisplaySettings.html">Display Setting</a> to use
when creating the display.
