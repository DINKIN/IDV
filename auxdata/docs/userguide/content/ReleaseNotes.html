<faqitem cat="Display Changes"></faqitem>

<faqitem q="New Image Displays" id="image_displays">
Two new image displays were added  to this release for
displaying satellite and NEXRAD  Level III data - Image
Display and Image Display over Topography. The old
image display has been renamed to Image Sequence Display
to reflect its specialty to that type of data. The Image
Display will eventually replace the Image Sequence Display
but the latter has been kept in for backward compatibility.
It will be removed in a subsequent release.

<faqitem cat="Chooser Changes"></faqitem>
<faqitem q="Timeline Selector" id="timeline_selector">
Several of the ADDE choosers now have a timeline for selecting
absolute time intervals.  For more information, see the

</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Support for Multi-banded Images" id="multiband">
The Satellite Image Chooser now supports selecting all bands

</faqitem>

<faqitem q="New Installers" id="new_installers">
There are two new installers available in the IDV Downloads
page for Windows Vista and newer Linux systems.  The Windows
<ul>
<li><b>Linux</b> We have had to support an
outdated version of Java 3D on Linux due to lagging
support for the latest OpenGL versions. The new installer
with the latest Java 3D should work with older OpenGL
versions, although you'll get a warning when the IDV
starts up. This new version of Java 3D contains a
significant performance improvement for point data
displays. 
<li><b>Windows Vista</b> The Windows Vista installer can be used 
on any Windows XP, 2000 or  Vista system, but may give warnings 
on systems with older graphics hardware.  Like the new Linux
installer, it contains the performance improvements in the
latest Java 3D.
