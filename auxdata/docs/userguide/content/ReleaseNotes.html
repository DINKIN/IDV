<faqitem cat="System Changes"></faqitem>

<faqitem q="Java Version 1.8" id="jv18">
  <p>
    Migrated the IDV to Java 8 and Java3D 1.6. The IDV is using
    Java 1.8 JVM on all platforms of this release.
  </p>
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Latest netCDF-Java Version" id="nj46">
  <p>
    The version of the netCDF-Java library currently distributed with the IDV is the 4.6.2. Its main
    feature is a rewrite of GRIB handling. This version of netCDF-Java includes changes:
      AWIPSsat projection, WRF lat/lon coordinates with time dependence, Updated grib1 table for NLDAS,
      handling of scalar runtime coordinate for GRIB collections.
      See the <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/blogs/news/entry/netcdf_java_library_and_tds10">
    netCDF-Java Library</a> for a more details on these changes.

<faqitem q="Forecast hour added" id="fhour">
The IDV can calculate the forecast hour based on the run time coordinate and its value
  can be accessed through the forecast hour macro.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="New Grid Trajectory and Curly Vector" id="ngtrajectory">
The new 2D gridded trajectory and the curly vector display are based on the new api of the VisAD library.
  Both displays are categorized as flow vector display. The vector plan view display will be created
  first and there are radio buttons to switch to the trajectory or curly vector display. The trajectory
  and the curly vector can be colored by the wind speed.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="3D Adaptive Resolution" id="3dAR">
  The Adaptisve Resolution (AR) feature in the IDV has been expanded to cover several 3 dimensional displays.
  When creating a 3D display or cross section display, the IDV calculates the resolution of the map view window,
  dynamically sets the data sampling in all 3 dimensions, and loads sufficient data to generate the image.

<faqitem q="Bug Fixes" id="bugfix">
We have discovered in a few circumstances the IDV OS X installers (always on
NOAA OS X machines for some reason) are not working as expected. In particular,
the IDV installers (not the IDV itself) try to use the Apple JRE 6. If the
installer does not find it, it tries to download a JRE 6 for OS X. This workflow
occasionally resulted in unreliable behavior crashing the installer. Moreover,
Java 6 was end-of-lifed quite a while ago so this solution is not sustainable
anyway. We now have a new installer strategy for OS X that relies on the JRE 7
that is distributed with the IDV application itself. This should hopefully
result in a more stable, long-term solution.
