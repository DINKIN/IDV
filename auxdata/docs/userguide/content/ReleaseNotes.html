<faqitem cat="System Changes"></faqitem>

<faqitem q="Java 7 / Java3D 1.6 migration" id="j3d">
<p>
Migrated the IDV to Java 7 and Java3D 1.6. On Mac OS X, no longer using the
Apple JVM (which is now defunct), and instead using an Oracle Java 1.7 JVM which
is packaged with the IDV similar to the IDV deployment on other platforms.

<faqitem q="Latest netCDF-Java Version" id="nj43">
<p>
A new version of the netCDF-Java library (4.3.22) is included in this release.
</p>
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Latest VisAD Version" id="visad">
<p>
A new version of the VisAD library is included in this release.
</p>
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Performance" id="performance">
Optimized Java Garbage Collection in the IDV. Optimized memory settings to avoid
performance problems.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Install4J Deployment Workflow" id="install4j">
Improved the deployment workflow of the IDV via Install4J. Users are now
presented with a current installation warning after they have selected a
directory where the IDV may be already installed. When a current installation
directory is detected and the user does not want to overwrite, they are
presented with a new directory.
</faqitem>

<faqitem cat="Display Changes"></faqitem>

<faqitem q="New Image Chooser" id="newimagechooser">
Added an image preview panel in
the <a href="./data/DataSourceProperties.html#spatialsubset"> data subset</a>
panel, and moved the image property widgets from the original chooser to the
Advanced panel in the subset window. The result is a more intuitive and
efficient user experience when selecting the area of interest before creating
the final display.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Contour Labeling" id="contours">
Made improvements in VisAD and the IDV to improve the labeling of contours
and how contours are defined in the IDV contour labeling UI.
</faqitem>


<faqitem cat="Data Changes"></faqitem>

<faqitem q="GEMPAK Upper Air format Support" id="gempakua">
The IDV now has the capability of viewing GEMPAK format upper air data files.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Match Display Region" id="matchdisplayregion">
The IDV can now match display regions. When the user selects this option in the
data source property or subset panel, the IDV will automatically spatially
subset to match the display area in the view window.  This is done by first
setting a region of interest in the main view window, and selecting "Match
Display Region" in the Region tab of the subset panel. If the "Match Display
Region" option is not selected before creating the display, you can reset this
option under View menu of
the <a href="./controls/index.html#DisplayControlViewMenu">Display Control</a>.
If the data source type is grid file, the IDV user can set "Match Display
Region" as a default property in the
<a href="./data/DataSourceProperties.html#spatialsubset">Data Source
Properties</a> window.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Adaptive Resolution" id="adaptiveresolution">
This is a new advanced feature in the IDV. When loading large datasets with PR
enabled, the IDV calculates the resolution of the map view window, dynamically
sets the data sampling, and loads sufficient data to generate the image. The
quality of the image is not compromised. The result of this improvement is more
efficient use of both client and server system resources thereby reducing
network traffic significantly. The Adaptive Resolution is a property in
the <a href="./tools/Preferences.html">User Preference</a>. It can also be set
in the
<a href="./ui/Menus.html#projectionmenu">Projections</a> drop down menu of main
view window.

<faqitem q="Known Problems" id="problems">
For a list of outstanding known problems, see the
<a href="Bugs.html">Known Problems</a> page.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Java Webstart" id="webstart">
Starting the IDV with Java Web Start is currently broken on all platforms. We
are hoping to revive it soon with the help of the JOGL and Java3D open source
community.
