<faqitem cat="Display Changes"></faqitem>

<faqitem q="Display Settings" id="displaysetting">
Users can save properties of display controls in favorite
display settings.  These can be used when displays are
created or shared between controls.  See the section
on <a href="tools/DisplaySettings.html">Display Settings</a>
in the User's Guide.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Set vertical range in cross sections" id="xsvertical">
Users can now set the vertical scale range in the Cross Section
and Data Transect Display controls.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Point data accumulation" id="pointacc">
Users can  show the aggregation of point observations through
time.  This is useful for showing how many observations accumulate
through time (e.g. earthquake epicenters, lightning plots) in a 
given area.  For more information, see the 
<a href="controls/StationModelControl.html">Point Data Plot</a>
control documentation.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="New diagnostic functions" id="griddiag">
The Jython library has been enhanced with many new 
functions.  Most of the GEMPAK grid diagnostics have been
implemented.  For a complete list, see
<a href="tools/JythonLib.html">Jython Library Functions</a>.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="GEMPAK grid reading" id="gemgrids">
The IDV can now read in GEMPAK grid files from local disk
and from a THREDDS Data Server (TDS). Only grids with 
no packing, Grib 1 or Grib 2 packing are supported at this
point.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Saving grids locally" id="localgrid">
You can now save remote grids to your local system and/or
use the IDV to subset these remote grids.  When you load in
a gridded dataset, you can use the [ug::menu {Write Grid}]
menu from the Data Source properties menu to save the grid.
The data will be saved in a netCDF file using the CF 1.0
convention.  This same mechanism can be used to subset a
local grid and/or convert from the native format to netCDF.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Text Point Data" id="csv">
Several improvements have been made to the Text Point Data Source.
Point data stored in comma-separated value (CSV) text files
or Excel spreadsheets can be read into the IDV.  The data source
has an metadata GUI which can be used to specify the parameters,
the units and the structure of the file.  For more information, 
see the <a href="data/TextPointData.html">Text Point Data File</a> 
page in the User's Guide.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Field Mask" id="fieldmask">
There is a new Field Mask option which allows you to define
a mask for a dataset such that only certain fields are shown
in the field selector.  The field mask can be used for a particular
dataset, or can be applied to similiar datasets.  Access this
feature through the Data Source properties menu using the
[ug::menu {Write Field Mask Plugin}] option. 
</faqitem>

<faqitem cat="Other Changes"></faqitem>

<faqitem q="Jython Shell" id="jshell">
A new interactive <a href="tools/JythonShell.html">Jython Shell</a>
can be accessed under the [ht::menu Edit Formulas {Jython Shell}]
menu.  This shell allows you to interactively write new procedures,
load in data and create displays.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Jython Library GUI" id="jgui">
The Jython library GUI has been updated to use a tree view instead
of tabs to access the various libraries.  It now has a search function
and facilities for automatically creating formulas from your
Jython methods.  For more information, see the
<a href="tools/Jython.html">Jython Library</a> documentation.
