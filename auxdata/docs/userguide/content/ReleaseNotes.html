The items below reflect changes since the 4.1 release.

<faq qlabel=" " alabel=" ">

<faqitem cat="System Changes"></faqitem>

<faqitem q="Java 7 / Java3D 1.6 migration" id="j3d">
<p>
Migrated the IDV to Java 7 and Java3D 1.6. On Mac OS X, no longer using the
Apple JVM (which is now defunct), and instead using an Oracle Java 1.7 JVM which
is packaged with the IDV similar to the IDV deployment on other platforms.
</p>
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Latest netCDF-Java Version" id="nj43">
<p>
A new version of the netCDF-Java library (4.3.22) is included in this release.
</p>
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Latest VisAD Version" id="visad">
<p>
A new version of the VisAD library is included in this release.
</p>
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Performance" id="performance">
Optimized Java Garbage Collection in the IDV. Optimized memory settings to avoid
performance problems.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Install4J Deployment Workflow" id="install4j">
Improved the deployment workflow of the IDV via Install4J. Users are now
presented with a current installation warning after they have selected a
directory where the IDV may be already installed. When a current installation
directory is detected and the user does not want to overwrite, they are
presented with a new directory.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="RAMADDA plugin" id="ramaddaPlugin">
The new RAMADDA plugin along with changes to the image generator allows
users to generate a movie and save it as a zip file of images. Users can then publish the zip file
to the RAMADDA server to be displayed by the image player.
</faqitem>

<faqitem cat="Display Changes"></faqitem>

<faqitem q="New Image Chooser" id="newimagechooser">
Added an image preview panel in
the <a href="./data/DataSourceProperties.html#spatialsubset"> data subset</a>
panel, and moved the image property widgets from the original chooser to the
Advanced panel in the subset window. The result is a more intuitive and
efficient user experience when selecting the area of interest before creating
the final display.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Contour Labeling" id="contours">
Made improvements in VisAD and the IDV to improve the labeling of contours
and how contours are defined in the IDV contour labeling UI.
</faqitem>


<faqitem cat="Data Changes"></faqitem>

<faqitem q="GEMPAK Upper Air format Support" id="gempakua">
The IDV now has the capability of viewing GEMPAK format upper air data files.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Match Display Region" id="matchdisplayregion">
The IDV can now match display regions. When the user selects this option in the
data source property or subset panel, the IDV will automatically spatially
subset to match the display area in the view window.  This is done by first
setting a region of interest in the main view window, and selecting "Match
Display Region" in the Region tab of the subset panel. If the "Match Display
Region" option is not selected before creating the display, you can reset this
option under View menu of
the <a href="./controls/index.html#DisplayControlViewMenu">Display Control</a>.
If the data source type is grid file, the IDV user can set "Match Display
Region" as a default property in the
<a href="./data/DataSourceProperties.html#spatialsubset">Data Source
Properties</a> window.

<p>
Another important use of the Match Display Region feature is when opening a bundle to a new
area of interest. This is done by first selecting an area of interest in the main view
window and opening a newly created bundle. You will be prompted whether you want
to use the Match Display Region. If this option is checked, the region of coverage
of the bundle will be replaced by the display region of the view window.

<faqitem q="Adaptive Resolution" id="adaptiveresolution">
This is a new advanced feature in the IDV. When loading large datasets with PR
enabled, the IDV calculates the resolution of the map view window, dynamically
sets the data sampling, and loads sufficient data to generate the image. The
quality of the image is not compromised. The result of this improvement is more
efficient use of both client and server system resources thereby reducing
network traffic significantly. The Adaptive Resolution is a property in
the <a href="./tools/Preferences.html">User Preference</a>. It can also be set
in the
<a href="./ui/Menus.html#projectionmenu">Projections</a> drop down menu of main
view window.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="CF Trajectories" id="cftrajectories">
IDV can now handle multiple trajectories in one CF-compliant file. When wanting
to view these data, select a Data Source Type of "Trajectory Sounding Files".
You will have to build the trajectory file in a CF compliant manner as described
<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/blogs/developer/en/entry/ipynb_cookbooks_to_create_cf">here</a>.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="CSV Time Matching" id="csvtimematching">
IDV can now apply time matching to the CSV point data files. When wanting
to do the time matching, you need to create the display first, and then
specify a driver time and select View > Times > Uses Time Driver Times in
the display control of CSV display, reload the data will create the display
with matching driver times.

    <faqitem cat="Bug Fixes/Known Problems"></faqitem>

<faqitem q="Bug Fixes" id="bugfix">
We have discovered in a few circumstances the IDV OS X installers (always on
NOAA OS X machines for some reason) are not working as expected. In particular,
the IDV installers (not the IDV itself) try to use the Apple JRE 6. If the
installer does not find it, it tries to download a JRE 6 for OS X. This workflow
occasionally resulted in unreliable behavior crashing the installer. Moreover,
Java 6 was end-of-lifed quite a while ago so this solution is not sustainable
anyway. We now have a new installer strategy for OS X that relies on the JRE 7
that is distributed with the IDV application itself. This should hopefully
result in a more stable, long-term solution.

For a list of outstanding known problems, see the
<a href="Bugs.html">Known Problems</a> page.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Java Webstart" id="webstart">
Starting the IDV with Java Web Start is currently broken on all platforms. We
are hoping to revive it soon with the help of the JOGL and Java3D open source
community.
