The items below reflect changes since the 5.0 release.

<faq qlabel=" " alabel=" ">

<faqitem cat="System Changes"></faqitem>

<faqitem q="Latest netCDF-Java Version" id="nj43">
  <p>
    The version of the netCDF-Java library currently distributed with the IDV is
    4.3.22-20140527112500.
</p>
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Install4J and IDV Start Script" id="install4j">
  Repaired Install4J uninstaller which had been broken for some time. Also fixed
  a path problem in the IDV start script where the IDV would not start properly
  if the IDV was started from a remote path.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="RAMADDA plugin" id="ramaddaPlugin">
The new RAMADDA plugin along with changes to the image generator allows users to
generate a movie and save it as a zip file of images. Users can then publish the
zip file to the RAMADDA server to be displayed by the image player.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="UNAVCO plugin" id="unavcoPlugin">
  Fixed the remote location of the UNAVCO plugin.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Windows Unknown Publisher" id="windowscert">
  The IDV installation application on Windows is now properly signed with a
  security certificate. There result of this change is during IDV installation,
  users will now see the publisher as "The University Corporation for
  Atmospheric Research".
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Mac OS X Gatekeeper" id="gatekeeper">
 IDV nightly build is finally properly signed vis a vis OS X gatekeeper. The
result is IDV users on OS X can now install the IDV in a straightforward manner
(instead of having to jump through awkward Finder hoops).
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Multiple IDVs on OS X (Yosemite)" id="gatekeeper">
  Multiple instances of the IDV can now run on OS X by starting the IDV with the
  (dock) icon. Moreover, fixed a problem on OS X Yosemite where attempting to
  start the IDV multiple times from the dock or icon would fail, and "ghost" IDV
  instances could not be killed.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="IDV Old Version Warning" id="versioncheck">
  Fixed a bug where the IDV old version warning mechanism was interefering with
  ISL scripts. Also refactored, and improved the code that handles this old
  version check.
</faqitem>


<faqitem cat="Display Changes"></faqitem>

<faqitem q="Webcams" id="webcam">
Fixed broken webcam links available in the IDV.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="New Image Chooser" id="newimagechooser">
Added an image preview panel in
the <a href="./data/DataSourceProperties.html#spatialsubset"> data subset</a>
panel, and moved the image property widgets from the original chooser to the
Advanced panel in the subset window. The result is a more intuitive and
efficient user experience when selecting the area of interest before creating
the final display.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Contour Labeling" id="contours">
Made improvements in VisAD and the IDV to improve the labeling of contours
and how contours are defined in the IDV contour labeling UI.
</faqitem>


<faqitem cat="Data Changes"></faqitem>

<faqitem q="GEMPAK Upper Air format Support" id="gempakua">
  The IDV now has the capability of viewing GEMPAK format upper air data files.
  We continue to make changes, improvements, and bug fixes in this area. We
  added documentation specifying that, for now, the GEMPAK format upper air data
  files must be supplied with the .gem suffix.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Match Display Region" id="matchdisplayregion">
The IDV can now match display regions. When the user selects this option in the
data source property or subset panel, the IDV will automatically spatially
subset to match the display area in the view window.  This is done by first
setting a region of interest in the main view window, and selecting "Match
Display Region" in the Region tab of the subset panel. If the "Match Display
Region" option is not selected before creating the display, you can reset this
option under View menu of
the <a href="./controls/index.html#DisplayControlViewMenu">Display Control</a>.
If the data source type is grid file, the IDV user can set "Match Display
Region" as a default property in the
<a href="./data/DataSourceProperties.html#spatialsubset">Data Source
Properties</a> window.

<p>
Another important use of the Match Display Region feature is when opening a bundle to a new
area of interest. This is done by first selecting an area of interest in the main view
window and opening a newly created bundle. You will be prompted whether you want
to use the Match Display Region. If this option is checked, the region of coverage
of the bundle will be replaced by the display region of the view window.

</p>
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Adaptive Resolution" id="adaptiveresolution">
This is a new advanced feature in the IDV. When loading large datasets with PR
enabled, the IDV calculates the resolution of the map view window, dynamically
sets the data sampling, and loads sufficient data to generate the image. The
quality of the image is not compromised. The result of this improvement is more
efficient use of both client and server system resources thereby reducing
network traffic significantly. The Adaptive Resolution is a property in
the <a href="./tools/Preferences.html">User Preference</a>. It can also be set
in the
<a href="./ui/Menus.html#projectionmenu">Projections</a> drop down menu of main
view window.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="CF Trajectories" id="cftrajectories">
IDV can now handle multiple trajectories in one CF-compliant file. When wanting
to view these data, select a Data Source Type of "Trajectory Sounding Files".
You will have to build the trajectory file in a CF compliant manner as described
<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/blogs/developer/en/entry/ipynb_cookbooks_to_create_cf">here</a>.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="CSV Time Matching" id="csvtimematching">
IDV can now apply time matching to the CSV point data files. When wanting
to do the time matching, you need to create the display first, and then
specify a driver time and select View > Times > Uses Time Driver Times in
the display control of CSV display, reload the data will create the display
with matching driver times.

    <faqitem cat="Bug Fixes/Known Problems"></faqitem>

<faqitem q="Bug Fixes" id="bugfix">
We have discovered in a few circumstances the IDV OS X installers (always on
NOAA OS X machines for some reason) are not working as expected. In particular,
the IDV installers (not the IDV itself) try to use the Apple JRE 6. If the
installer does not find it, it tries to download a JRE 6 for OS X. This workflow
occasionally resulted in unreliable behavior crashing the installer. Moreover,
Java 6 was end-of-lifed quite a while ago so this solution is not sustainable
anyway. We now have a new installer strategy for OS X that relies on the JRE 7
that is distributed with the IDV application itself. This should hopefully
result in a more stable, long-term solution.

<faqitem q="Known Problems" id="problems">
For a list of outstanding known problems, see the
<a href="Bugs.html">Known Problems</a> page.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Java Webstart" id="webstart">
Starting the IDV with Java Web Start is currently broken on all platforms. We
are hoping to revive it soon with the help of the JOGL and Java3D open source
community.
