<faqitem q="Latest netCDF-Java Version" id="nj43">
<p>
A new version of the netCDF-Java library (4.3.16) is included in this release. This version of netCDF-Java
includes major changes to the way GRIB 1/2 files are handled. See the <a
    href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf-java/formats/GribFiles.html"> netCDF-Java GRIB
documentation</a> for a more details on these changes.
</p>

<p>
One major outcome of this change is that GRIB variable names will now be generated in a very general way. This
means that bundles that were generated with a previous version of the IDV might break. In order to aid users in
the transition between netCDF-Java 4.2 and 4.3, the netCDF-Java library has provided a mapping of old variable
names and new variable names for the datasets served on the Unidata THREDDS Data Server (TDS), and this mapping
is being used 'under the hood' in the IDV to minimize the impact of these changes on users.
</p>

<p>
For users reading GRIB files from other locations (local files or other remote servers), the IDV now allows
users to make custom variable name mappings. New variable mappings should be placed in the following file (found
under the users home directory):
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;.unidata/idv/DefaultIdv/varrenamer.xml
</p>

<p>
The structure of this file is quite simple:
</p>

<p><code>
&lt;varrenamers&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;varrenamer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;old="oldNameHere"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new="newNameHere" /&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;varrenamer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;old="anotherOldNameHere"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new="anotherNewNameHere" /&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;/varrenamers&gt;
</code></p>

<p>
Changes to the way GRIB files are served via the Unidata TDS server have also been made. The impact of this
change on IDV users is that the dataset URLs that point to GRIB resources will change, which will break bundles
that point to the main Unidata TDS (thredds.ucar.edu, previously known as motherlode.ucar.edu).
</p>

<p>Again, in order to aid users in this transition, the netCDF-Java library has provided a mapping between the old
and new dataset URL paths for all datasets served through the Unidata TDS. As with the variable name changes,
the URL mapping for datasets on the Unidata TDS is being used 'under the hood' in the IDV to minimize the impact
on users.
</p>

<p>
Currently, the latest version of TDS (4.3), where URL related impacts will be seen, is not yet running on the
main Unidata TDS, but the transition to the new server will happen in the near future. The IDV has a new plugin
that will allow users to test the transition before it happens by redirecting all data request to the main
Unidata TDS (currently running 4.2) to thredds-test.ucar.edu, which is running TDS 4.3. The plugin can be found
in the IDV plugin manager under [ht::menu {Available Plugins} {Data Sources}{Test Unidata TDS 4.2->4.3
Upgrade}]. Note that this plugin should be removed once thredds.ucar.edu is running TDS 4.3.
</p>

<p>
As TDS servers in the community begin to upgrade to TDS 4.3, IDV users will likely need to use custom URL
mappings. New URL mappings should be placed in the following file (found under the users home directory):
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;.unidata/idv/DefaultIdv/urlmaps.xml
</p>

<p>
Again, the format of this file is quite simple:
</p>

<p><code>
&lt;urlmaps&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;urlmap<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;type="opendap"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;old="oldthreddsserver1.edu/"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new="newthreddsserver1.edu/" /&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;urlmap<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;type="opendap"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;old="threddsserver2.edu/thredds/dodsC/old/path/"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new="threddsserver2.edu/thredds/dodcC/new/path/" /&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;/urlmaps&gt;
</code></p>

<p>
In the first example, a new THREDDS server has replaced an old server - all requests going to
oldthreddsserver1.edu will be directed to newthreddsserver1.edu. The second example is where the URL path to a
particular dataset has changed, either because the product has been replaced (for example, the RUC to the RAP
transition) or the maintainer of the TDS server has changed the way data are cataloged. Note in both cases the
type of URL is an opendap URL. In the future, this mechanism will be used to redirect other types of data
requests, such as ADDE requests.

<faqitem cat="Display Changes"></faqitem>

<faqitem q="Grid Trajectory Display" id="gridTrajectory">
The IDV now can plot 2D and 3D gridded trajectory. The 2D and 3D grid trajectory
are derived data choices based on the horizontal velocity compnoents and vertical
velocity component. The trajectory is colored by a user selected parameter. There are
three options in the <a href="controls/GridTrajectoryControl.html">Grid Trajectory Control</a>
to initialize the trajectory intial area.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Contour labelling frequency" id="contourlabelfq">
Added a user interface to change the frequency of the contour labels.
The density of the label can now be increased or decreased along the contours
or horizontally across the display.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Webcams" id="webcam">
Fixed broken webcam links available in the IDV.

<faqitem cat="ISL Changes"></faqitem>

<faqitem q="ISL Export Tag to Save Data to Comma Separated Value (CSV) and netCDF Formats" id="export">
The IDV Scripting Language (ISL) has new capability to <a href="isl/DataAndDisplays.html#export">export</a> data available in ObsListControl (e.g. a Point Data List display for METAR data).
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="ISL Image Tag animation_index Attribute" id="animation">
The IDV Scripting Language (ISL) <a href="isl/ImagesAndMovies.html#image">image</a> tag has a new animation_index attribute to specify multiple images in the animation.
