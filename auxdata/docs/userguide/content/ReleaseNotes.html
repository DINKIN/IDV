  <p>
    The version of the netCDF-Java library currently distributed with the IDV is the 4.5.5-SNAPSHOT. This version
    of netCDF-Java includes one fix on top of the 4.5.4 release. The 4.5.4 release includes changes to new I/O NIO.2 of Java 7, HttpClient 4, improved projections, and updated grib
    tables. See the <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/blogs/news/entry/netcdf_java_library_and_tds8">

<faqitem q="Install4J and IDV Start Script" id="install4j">
  Repaired Install4J uninstaller which had been broken for some time. Also fixed
  a path problem in the IDV start script where the IDV would not start properly
  if the IDV was started from a remote path.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="RAMADDA plugin" id="ramaddaPlugin">
The new RAMADDA plugin along with changes to the image generator allows users to
generate a movie and save it as a zip file of images. Users can then publish the
zip file to the RAMADDA server to be displayed by the image player.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="UNAVCO plugin" id="unavcoPlugin">
  Fixed the remote location of the UNAVCO plugin.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Windows Unknown Publisher" id="windowscert">
  The IDV installation application on Windows is now properly signed with a
  security certificate. There result of this change is during IDV installation,
  users will now see the publisher as "The University Corporation for
  Atmospheric Research".
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Mac OS X Gatekeeper" id="gatekeeper">
 IDV nightly build is finally properly signed vis a vis OS X gatekeeper. The
result is IDV users on OS X can now install the IDV in a straightforward manner
(instead of having to jump through awkward Finder hoops).
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Multiple IDVs on OS X (Yosemite)" id="gatekeeper">
  Multiple instances of the IDV can now run on OS X by starting the IDV with the
  (dock) icon. Moreover, fixed a problem on OS X Yosemite where attempting to
  start the IDV multiple times from the dock or icon would fail, and "ghost" IDV
  instances could not be killed.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="IDV Old Version Warning" id="versioncheck">
  Fixed a bug where the IDV old version warning mechanism was interefering with
  ISL scripts. Also refactored, and improved the code that handles this old
  version check.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="IDV Webstart Working Again" id="webstart">
  After security and Java 3D problems, the IDV is working again via Java
  WebStart.
</faqitem>

<faqitem cat="Display Changes"></faqitem>

<faqitem q="Webcams" id="webcam">
Fixed broken webcam links available in the IDV.
</faqitem>


<faqitem cat="Data Changes"></faqitem>

<faqitem q="CFRadial netcdf format Support" id="cfradial">
  The IDV now has the capability of viewing CFRadial netcdf format radar data files.
  We works with engineers from NCAR/EOL groups and continue to make changes, improvements,
  and bug fixes in this area.
</faqitem>


<faqitem q="AMRC Text Point" id="amrctextpoint">
IDV can now handle text point data from the Antarctic Meteorological Research Center(AMRC).
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="CSV Time Matching" id="csvtimematching">
IDV can now apply time matching to the CSV point data files. When wanting
to do the time matching, you need to create the display first, and then
specify a driver time and select View > Times > Uses Time Driver Times in
the display control of CSV display, reload the data will create the display
with matching driver times.

    <faqitem cat="Bug Fixes/Known Problems"></faqitem>

<faqitem q="Bug Fixes" id="bugfix">
We have discovered in a few circumstances the IDV OS X installers (always on
NOAA OS X machines for some reason) are not working as expected. In particular,
the IDV installers (not the IDV itself) try to use the Apple JRE 6. If the
installer does not find it, it tries to download a JRE 6 for OS X. This workflow
occasionally resulted in unreliable behavior crashing the installer. Moreover,
Java 6 was end-of-lifed quite a while ago so this solution is not sustainable
anyway. We now have a new installer strategy for OS X that relies on the JRE 7
that is distributed with the IDV application itself. This should hopefully
result in a more stable, long-term solution.
