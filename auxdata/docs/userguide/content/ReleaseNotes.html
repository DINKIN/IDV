<faqitem cat="System Changes"></faqitem>

<faqitem q="Use of netCDF 4.0 library" id="whatsnext">
The IDV now uses the non-alpha Java-netCDF 4.0 library.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Use of Java 1.6" id="jdk6">
This will be the last version of IDV that will run under
Java 5 (aka Java 1.5).
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Parallel Data Reading and Rendering" id="multi-threading">
With multiple core machines becoming ubiquitous, the IDV can now take
advantage of using multiple processors for data reading and display.
If you are running the IDV on a multi-core machine you can configure 
the IDV to render individual time steps in parallel. You can also do 
remote data reads in parallel. This typically results in a 50% reduction 
in overall data readings and rendering time.  See the 
<a href="misc/PerformanceTuning.html">Performance Tuning</a>
page for more information.
</faqitem>

<faqitem cat="Display Changes"></faqitem>
<faqitem q="New display for RHI data" id="rhicontrol">
Radar RHI sweeps in DORADE and UF format can not be displayed
in the <a href="controls/RadarRhiControl.html">Radar RHI control</a>.
This provides a view in the 3D window as well as the control window.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="3D Hodograph and Table Readout of Soundings" id="hodograph">
The sounding display (e.g.SkewT) has been modified to include
a 3D Hodograph and a table readout.  The data in the table can be 
exported to a text file for import into other applications.
</faqitem>

<faqitem cat="Data Changes"></faqitem>
<faqitem q="UF Radar data reading" id="uf_radar">
Preliminary work has been done on reading Universal Format (UF)
radar data in the IDV.  We have tested on samples that we have
available, but if IDV users find it does not work with their
UF files, please send samples to Unidata IDV support.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="First guess grid for Objective Analysis" id="oa_grid">
Users can now input a first guess field for the Barnes objective
analysis of point data.  When you load in point data, a new
set of choices (<i>Gridded Fields (with first guess)</i>) is available.
When you select one of these choices, you will be prompted for
the grid you wish to use.
</faqitem>


<faqitem cat="User Interface Changes"></faqitem>
<faqitem q="Color Table Editor" id="color_table_ui">
The behavior of the Color Table Editor has been changed in this
version.  Previously, the breakpoints were overloaded to be
an indication of a point and also used to paint in the edit mode.
Since the painting action would change the value of the breakpoint,
the new color table model uses the breakpoints only as markers.
Painting is done with a dragging motion on the color bar now.
For more information, see the <a href="tools/ColorTableEditor.html">
Color Table Editor</a> section of the User's Guide.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="New Display Settings widget" id="displaysettings">
The display settings user interface has been reworked to allow
easier creation and application of Display Settings.
</faqitem>


<faqitem q="Known Problems" id="knownproblems">
