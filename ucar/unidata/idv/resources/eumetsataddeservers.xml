<!--
Each server tag has a name and an optional description.

Each server tag can contain any number of group tags or type tags.
For top-level group tags they need to have a type attribute (e.g.,
one of image, radar, grid, point, etc.) They can either have a comma
separated names attribute or a single name attribute. For the case with a single
name attribute there can also be a description.

You can also group a number of group tags under a type tag. where the type tag
has a name attribute. In this case the group tags do not need the type attribute (
they essentially get it from their container type tag.
