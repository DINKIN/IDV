To address the problem of discovery of RAMADDA data servers we have developed a
server registry facility within RAMADDA.
<p>

A RAMADDA server can be enabled to be a registry for other servers. 
We term this a "registry server".  This configuration is done through the
<i>Admin-&gt;Settings-&gt;Site and Contact Information</i> page:

Likewise, a RAMADDA server can be configured to have 0 or more 
servers that it registers itself with. In this case, a RAMADDA server
that is registering itself with a registry server is known as a "registry client". 
By default a RAMADDA server comes with an initial registry server:<br>
<i>http://motherlode.ucar.edu/repository</i>


<h3>Registry Process</h3>

The following diagram shows the basic sequence of the registration process.

When a client starts up or when its configuration has changed the client  will notify each of its registry
servers passing its base URL as an argument:
<blockquote>
<i>http://registryserver/repository/registry/add?registry.client=http://registryclient/repository</i>
</blockquote>

The registry server will attempt to connect back to the client 
passing its base URL as an argument:
<blockquote>
<i>http://clientserver/repository/registry/info?registry.server=http://registryserver/repository</i>
</blockquote>

The client, on receipt of this request, will check if the given registry server is in its list
of registry servers. If it is then it responds with an xml listing of its server information including
its title (the repository title) and description (the description of its top-level group).
On a successful  response from the client
the server will store the new client information into its database.
<p>
If the requesting registry server is not in the list of servers held by a client then an error
is returned. On a failed request the registry server will remove the client listing from
the database.

<p>
A registry server stores a list of client information (base URL, title, description) in the database.
At start-up and at certain intervals a registry server will run through its list of clients, executing the
above registry process. It does this to keep its listing up to date and to remove any clients that are no
longer running.  If, after removal of a client, the client starts up again it will run through its registry
process (as described above) to be reinserted into the server list.


<p>
A registry server provides a listing of its known clients at:<br>
<a href="http://motherlode.ucar.edu/repository/registry/list">http://motherlode.ucar.edu/repository/registry/list</a>


<h3>Federated Searches</h3>
We intend to use this basic registry service as a way in which RAMADDA servers can support aggregated search.
A client server will, on successful registration with a registry server, request the collection
of client servers available from its registry server and store these in its database.
The administrator of the client server will be able to select which of the other servers
should be made available for federated search.
<p>
When there is such a collection of servers selected the Advanced Search form will have an entry
listing the servers and will allow the end user to select which, if any, of the external servers
should also be searched. When the search request is sent to the initial server if there are external
servers selected that search will also be applied to those servers.
<p>
The big question is how to display those search results. The easy way is simply to show an html iframe
for each of the remote search servers. There are many cases where this will be effective for the end user.
However, we also want to be able to aggregate the results in the context of the original server and
display the results as on collection (e.g., as a THREDDS catalog, an RSS feed, etc.) In this case the original
server would launch each search request in a separate thread with the result output type being set to
the internal RAMADDA xml format (as opposed to getting HTML back). The XML results would then be
turned into RAMADDA's internal data model structures and then be displayed accordingly.
