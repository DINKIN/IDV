If you are like most people you don't want to have to deal with lengthy install and configuration processes.
This document will show you how to have a RAMADDA server running on your machine serving  up your data
sets in about 5 minutes.
<p>



<ul>

<li> Requirements: You need to have Java 1.6 (or higher) installed on your machine. Also, by default RAMADDA runs on port 8080 so this port should be open through your firewall.

<li> To download RAMADDA from the Unidata site you need to be registered. If you are not already you can <a target="_register" href="https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/account/account.jsp">register here</a>.

<li> Download the <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/ramadda/ftp/repository.zip">repository.zip</a> file and unzip  to where you want to install RAMADDA.

<li> Change directory to the ramadda install directory and (assuming you have java in your path) run <i>ramadda.sh</i>.
<br>
To run RAMADDA run the ramadda.sh in the release directory. This just does:<pre>
   java -Xmx512m -jar repository.jar
</pre>


By default the server is on port 8080.  To change the port do edit ramadda.sh and change the line to:<pre>
    java -Xmx512m -jar repository.jar -port &lt;some port&gt;
</pre>


<li> Now, in your web browser go to: http://yourserver:8080/repository

<li> Go through the initial configuration pages, create an administrator account and log in.


<li> Now, lets assume you have a data directory on your server
