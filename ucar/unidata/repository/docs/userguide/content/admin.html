[ht::head {Admin Settings}]

<%nochildlist%>

If you are a site administator an &quot;Admin&quot; link should be shown on the left
of every page. This takes you to a set of Site Administration pages.
<p>
The main admin settings page consists of:

<subhead  id="contact"  intoc="false">Site and Contact Information</subhead>

Specify the RAMADDA administator email for when RAMADDA sends email to users.
The Mail Server is the smtp mail server that RAMADDA can use to send email.
If this is not defined then user's cannot reset their passwords via email.
<p>
The Hostname and HTTP port should be set. RAMADDA uses these when it creates an absolute URL in some content  (e.g.,
a generated THREDDS catalog).
For information regarding SSL see the <a href="faq.html#ssl">FAQ</a>.
<p>
For information on the Server Registry settings  see <a href="remoteservers.html">remoteservers.html</a>.


<subhead  id="access"  intoc="false">Access</subhead>

can allow RAMADDA services to inject files into the LDM queue by specifying the path to the pqinsert program and the queue location.
