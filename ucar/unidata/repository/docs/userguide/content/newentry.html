[ht::head {Creating Groups and Entries}]

<%nochildlist%>

When you are logged in and you have the access to create a new group or
entry under the group that you are viewing there will be a &quot;New Entry or Group&quot; icon button
shown in the toolbar: <img src="images/new.gif">


[ht::cimg images/newentrytoolbar.gif {} {border=0}]

Clicking on this icon will take you to a form where you can choose
what you want to create:

[ht::cimg images/creategroup.gif {}  {border=0}]

Selecting &quot;Group&quot; and pressing Go will take you to the
create group form:

[ht::cimg images/newgroupform.gif {} {border=0}]

Enter a name and an optional description, date range and lat/lon bounding box.


<subhead intoc="false" id="createentry">Uploading Files</subhead>
To upload a file to a RAMADDA repository you create a new Entry.
Go back to the original form and select &quot;File&quot;:
[ht::cimg images/createentry.gif {}  {border=0}]

The Create Entry form allows you to upload a file or specify a URL:

[ht::cimg images/newentryform.gif {} {border=0}]

The minimal you need to enter here is the file or URL. The other fields
are optional. If you do not enter a name then the file name is used.
<p>
If you have a number of files that you want to upload you can make a .zip file
of them on your machine and check on the &quot; Unzip Archive&quot; button.
<p>
If you are uploading a netcdf file (or another data type that can be opened,
e.g., grib, radar, area file, etc) checking &quot;Add Metadata&quot;
will have RAMADDA crack open the file and harvest the time range, lat/lon
bounding box, global attributes and variables and add them as Metadata of
this Entry.
<p>
The &quot;Data Type&quot; is an optional and arbitrary data type  that can 
be used to search for entries of this type.
<p>
The &quot;Date Pattern&quot; can be used to match on the file name to automatically 
figure out the date of this entry.
