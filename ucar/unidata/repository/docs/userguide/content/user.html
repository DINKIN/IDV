If you have an account on a RAMADDA server you can login by following the
login link:

[ht::cimg images/login.jpg {} {width=600}]

If you have forgotten your user name or password and if the RAMADDA server has been configured to send email there will be links shown to send you a reminder of your user name and to reset your password.

Once logged in there is a link with your name shown on the left which 
will take you to your user settings page:

[ht::cimg images/userhome.jpg {} {width=600}]
