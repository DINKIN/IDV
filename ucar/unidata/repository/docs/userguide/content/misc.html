<h3>Copying a Database</h2>
If you ran RAMADDA with the default settings annd created some content that is in the database 
and you want to switch databases (e.g., from derby to mysql). Log in to the original RAMADDA
and go to the Admin-&gt;SQL page. There is a Dump Database link. This will give you a text file of the
entire database. Note: This might be a big file. You can save this file on the server or have it local.
<p>
Then, reconfigure RAMADDA to point to the new database and login again. Note: you'll have to
add a new admin password, etc. Then go to the Admin-&gt;SQL page. If you saved the SQL file on the 
server then just enter:<pre>
file:/path/to/sql/file
</pre>
in the text area and hit execute.
<p>
If you have the SQL file on your local machine upload through the sql file form.
<p>
Its probably best to shutdown and then restart RAMADDA after doing this and you should have
your old database running in the new RAMADDA. 
<p>
If you changed systems then you also need to copy over the storage directory tree to the
new system. This is in:
<pre>&lt;ramadda_home&gt;/storage</pre>





<h2>Building from Source</h2>
The  source release creates, at the top level, the ucar source tree and a lib directory. 
The lib directory has two jar files:<pre>
lib/repositorylib.jar
lib/repositorytds.jar
</pre>

To compile stand-alone (e.g., using javac) put those 2 jar files in your class path.
<p>
To compile using ant:<br>
The default ant target  (all) will compile the repository source and create:
<pre>
lib/repository.jar
lib/repository.war
</pre>


You can run the repository stand-alone by doing:
<pre>java -jar repository.jar</pre>


<p>
The repository.war is a tomcat war file that needs to be placed in the tomcat install area.
