<faqitem cxat="Logins and User Account" q="I forgot my user id. How do I retrieve it?" >
If your RAMADDA site has been configured to send email (see <a href="#email">here</a> to configure email)
then on the Login page you should see &quot;Forget your User ID?&quot; and
&quot;Forget your Password?&quot; links. 
</faqitem>


<faqitem id="checkbox" q="How do I select multiple checkboxes at once?">
In RAMADDA when there is a collection of checkboxes in a form (e.g., in the entry list or in the edit metadata form)
selecting one and then
selecting another with a Shift-Click toggles the range of checkboxes between the first the second
checkbox clicked. Doing a Control-Click on a checkbox toggles all of them on or off.

<faqitem cat="Administration" id="ssl" q="How do I configure SSL access to RAMADDA?" >
To configure SSL access see <a href="installing.html#ssl">here</a> if you are running under Tomcat.
See <a href="installing.html#ssljetty">here</a> if you are running stand-alone.

<faqitem q="When I am using the command line client to publish to RAMADDA I get a error about SSL certificates" id="ssl">
The repository client needs to be able to tell Java that its OK to use self-signed certificates from that server. 
From <a href="http://paulszulc.wordpress.com/2009/08/05/headache-pill-unable-to-find-valid-certification-path-to-requested-target/"> this reference</a> you can take the following steps:
<ul>
<li>  Find the servers .cer file. This is most easily done by hitting the server with your browser and then exporting the cer file from your browser to your machine. On firefox go to:<pre>
Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Cryptography -&gt; List certificates -&gt; Export
</pre>
Or under Preferences:
<pre>
Advanced -&gt; Encryption -&gt; View Certificates
</pre>
Save it as "cert.cer"

<li> Generate a keystore:<pre>
Keystore can be generated using tool called “keytool”, that is included with every JDK. In command line type:
keytool -import -trustcacerts -keystore cacerts -storepass somepassword -noprompt -file cert.cer
where:
-file points to .cer file you generated a moment ago (here “cert.cer”)
-keystore is name of the generated keystore file, any name will suffice (here “cacerts”)
-storepass is password for the keystore (here “somepassword”)
</pre>

<li> Configure the client to use the "cacerts" file: <ul>

<li> From the Java command line you can specify system properties:
<pre>
java -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/path/to/your/cacerts/file -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=somepassword ...
</pre>
Or by default the client will look in:<pre>
&lt;home&gt;/.unidata/repository/cacerts
&lt;current working directory&gt;/cacerts
&lt;home&gt;/cacerts
</pre>
and will set the password to (literally) "somepassword" if its not set with the -D option.
</ul>

</ul>

<faqitem cat="Administration" id="allowedlogin" q="I want to restrict where users can login from" >
For security reasons you can configure what IP addresses users are allowed to login from.
In your <i>repository.properties</i> file in your local RAMADDA directory, e.g.,<pre>
&lt;home&gt;/.unidata/repository/repository.properties</pre>
add the property:<pre>

##Comma separated list of ip addresses (or prefixes) that are the ones where the user can login
##If blank then login is allowed from anywhere
ramadda.login.allowedips=
##e.g.:
##ramadda.login.allowedips=127.0.0,201.43.72.5
</pre>
</faqitem>


<faqitem cat="Administration" id="fixssl" q="Oops, I told RAMADDA to use an SSL port and SSL is not working. Now I cannot access the admin page to turn off SSL and I'm stuck. What can I do?" >
You need to comment out the ramadda.ssl.port property in your .properties file.
Alternatively, you can run RAMADDA with the command line argument:
<pre>-Dramadda.ssl.ignore=true</pre>
</faqitem>

<faqitem cat="Administration" q="I forgot the administrator password and cannot access RAMADDA. How do I login?" >
You can specify an administrator user id and password from the command line when starting RAMADDA.
If you are running RAMADDA stand alone then just provide the arguments:<pre>
-admin &lt;user id&gt; &lt;password&gt;
</pre>
This creates a new user id if needed and sets the password.
<p>
If you are running RAMADDA under Tomcat then change the web.xml to pass in command line arguments
using the &quot;args&quot; entry. This is a comma separated value list of the command line arguments
that are processed by RAMADDA.
<pre>
    &lt;param-name&gt;args&lt;/param-name&gt;
    &lt;param-value&gt;-admin,userid,password&lt;/param-value&gt;
</pre>

<p>
You can also set a username/password  in the repository.properties file in the RAMADDA home directory. Just add:<pre>
ramadda.admin=userid:password
</pre>
and then restart RAMADDA. This sets the password for the given userid.
Note: you should remove this entry once you have reset your password.
</faqitem>



<faqitem cat="Administration" id="email" q="How do I configure RAMADDA to send email?" >
RAMADDA can send email for both the password reset process and for monitoring new entries.
On the main Site Administration  page under the &quot;Contact&quot; area you can specify
a SMTP server that RAMADDA will use to send email.
