<ol class="step">

  <li>Using the latest 80 km CONUS North American Model (NAM) data, create 
      a display of color filled contours of sea level pressure, 500 hPa heights
      and isosurface of wind speed.</li>

  <li>Display sea level pressure as contours draped over topography.</li>

  <li>Create display of geopotential height contours at 500 mb on a topography
      surface of the pressure from the latest GFS 80 km CONUS grid.
       <ul>
       <li>Create a color filled contour display of geopotential height
       over topography.  When prompted for the topography field, select
       geopotential.
       <li> Now do the same for contours over topography.
       <li> Turn sharing for both displays.
       <li> Set the level to 500 hPa.
       <li> Set the vertical scale to 4800 to 6000 meters to exaggerate the
            effect.
       </ul>
   </li>
