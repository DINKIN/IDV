{
Maps in the IDV are shown using the Map display control. There are  two ways this 
control is used: as  the default  background maps and as a user created map display.
The control window is composed of two tabs. The first lists the set of
available maps:

New maps may be added through the [ug::menu Edit] menu. You can choose to add any of the predefined
maps available to the IDV or you can select a map file (e.g., a shape file)  from the
file system.
<p>
The  [ug::menu File {Default Maps} {Save  as the Default Map Preference}] menu item  allows you to save the current
set of maps in a display as the default maps. When a new view window is created the maps that
are saved as the default are used as the background maps.

will display incorrectly when fast rendering is turned on.
The &quot;plus&quot; icon on the right allows you to add the given map as a Map Data Source. This allows you to do
display the given map in 3D draped over topography and/or do spatial analysis using the map (e.g., grid averages within a map).

The link button, when on, will apply any change to a particular map (e.g., color, line width) to all visible maps.
